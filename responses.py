    "Here’s how our accountability system keeps you on track:\n"
    "• **Join the Accountability Room:** When you join, please share your goal for the session. Stay for at least 25 minutes to count towards your accountability streak.\n"
    "• **Daily Accountability Sessions:** Every day at 9 PM PST, we hold a group accountability session. You're encouraged to join us to work on your tasks with group support.\n"
    "• **Session Flexibility:** The streak system works asynchronously. As long as you join the Accountability Room for 25 minutes, it will count towards your streak, regardless of the time.\n"
    "• **Session Wrap-Up:** Before you leave, let us know what you accomplished and what's next on your agenda.\n"
    "• **Community Engagement:** Feel free to notify the group when you plan to work. Others might join you if the schedule fits!\n"
    "• **Track Your Progress:** I track both your current streak and your longest streak.\n\n"
    "Thinking about adding a 'streak freeze' feature:\n"
    "• **Streak Freeze:** Earn a freeze by consistently engaging for a set number of days. This can save your streak if you miss a day!\n"
    "What do you think? How many days should be required to earn a streak freeze?"
